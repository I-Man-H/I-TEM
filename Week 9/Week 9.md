# Discussion Questions
_PARTICIPATION MARKS IN YOUR TERM ASSIGNMENT WILL BE BASED ON YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE DISCUSSION, SO PLEASE CONTRIBUTE MEANINGFULLY._

Consider the scenario of your VR headset start-up and answer the following questions.

1. Assume that before any of the software code for the VR headset is committed to the project’s GitHub repository, it needs to be reviewed by another developer and the tech lead, and it also needs to be unit-tested and integration tested.
  * What types of waste(s) is/are present in this scenario?
  * How can you minimise the said waste(s)?
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of storing the VR headset prototypes each night in a secure locker in a secure room separated from the workspaces where the development work takes place?


# Term Assignment
WEEK 9 ACTIVITY – BLOCKCHAIN START-UP - LEAN SIX SIGMA

1. Assume that after thorough market research and studying the Australian national blockchain roadmap, you have decided to form a new tech start-up called UCChain that specialises in developing blockchain-based services for the automotive industry.
2. You can make assumptions about the exact types of services you’re offering.
3. Here are some articles on how blockchain can be used in the automotive industry:

## SCENARIO – UCCHAIN RECRUITMENT PROCESS


1. The HR department at UCChain currently uses a long and tedious process to recruit new employees.
2. They place ads for openings on different websites, and prospective candidates must send their resumes and cover letters to Mr. Monro, who works in the HR department. He sorts through the resumes and cover letters and shortlists the best candidates.
3. He then forwards it to Mr Thomas, who is an engineering manager responsible for talent acquisition, who then gets in touch with the shortlisted applicants via email to get to know them better and arrange a phone call. He further shortlists candidates based on his interaction with them and invites the shortlisted candidates for an interview.
4. Meanwhile, Mr. Monro sends emails to the rejected candidates informing them of their results.
5. The interview panel has 5 people, ranging from developers to senior executive managers, and all of them are given a week to finalise their decision and send it to Mr Thomas, who consolidates their decisions and emails the accepted
candidates with an offer, which they are given two weeks to accept or reject.
6. Once a candidate accepts their offer by sending back a signed acceptance letter, Mr Thomas notifies the HR department, who then gets in touch with the newly hired employee to send them forms that need to be filled out.


## QUESTION (FOR BOTH 9789 & 9784) – IDENTIFYING & MINIMISING WASTES

1. What are the different types of wastes that are present in the scenario described above?
2. Develop strategies to minimise the identified wastes.

_Hint:_ Consider automating some of the processes.

_WORD COUNT: no more than 400 words._

# SCENARIO – UCCHAIN & UCCAR – MOTION WASTE

* The following slide contains the layout of the HR office of UCChain in Canberra.
* There are 16 employees in the office, and it has a printer and a vending machine.
* The employees (especially 7, 11, 13 and 16 often have to print documents like resumes, forms, etc).
* All the employees also use the vending machine to get some snacks during the break.
* The toilets are past the door, and employees use them regularly.

  * D - Door

## QUESTION (9784 ONLY) – REDUCING MOTION WASTE

1. Identify the different motion wastes that are present in the current layout. (200 words or less)
2. Draw a new layout for the UCChain HR office that reduces motion waste.


_Note: You can use tools like draw.io, Figma, Paint, etc._



# GENERAL TIPS FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS

* Be succinct and to the point – *Do not* exceed the word limit
* Don’t simply make assertions – justify your claims with arguments based on research supported by references
* Use the links and resources provided for reference, but do your own research as well
* Use the textbook and lecture slides to learn & understand the unit content and apply the concepts in your answers
* Brainstorm ideas as a group and divide the work fairly and evenly
* Save your responses to the term assignment questions in your group’s shared working area
* Explicitly state any assumptions that you make (doesn’t count towards word count).
