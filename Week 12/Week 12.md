* Does not influence presentation marks but is marked separately based on the quality of feedback given.
* Download the template on Canvas: [click here](https://uclearn.canberra.edu.au/courses/15489/assignments/122927)
* Please complete it during team presentations and submit it on the link above.

# TERM ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## TERM ASSIGNMENT – GENERAL INFORMATION

1. Group assignment
   * Only one member needs to submit.
   * Every member will get an individualised mark.
2. Will be released this week.
3. **Due at the end of week 13**
4. **6** questions in total – each worth 5 marks.
   * **5** questions from tutorial slides.
   * **1** question from independent study activity.
5. **2** marks for referencing (IEEE or Harvard style).
6. **3** marks for formatting, style, spelling and grammar.


## TERM ASSIGNMENT – MARKS BREAKDOWN

**40 marks in total**

1. 35 marks
  * For answering the questions
  * Group marks, but individualised based on peer evaluation index
2. 5 marks
  * For submitting a valid peer evaluation
  * Binary – 5 for valid, 0 for invalid, no in-between

## Term Assignment – Peer Evaluation

1. Questionnaire with 10 criteria
2. Provide a score between 0-10 for each criterion for each team member (including yourself)
3. The peer evaluation is used to create a peer evaluation index (PEI)
4. The group marks (out of 35) are multiplied by the PEI to get the individualised score

## Peer Evaluation

1. Do it honestly and fairly
   * In line with the ACS code of ethics
2. Part of the unit’s learning outcome
   * Evaluation is part of managing human resources
   * One of the skills of a good engineering manager is to be able to fairly and justly evaluate team members

# IMPORTANT
**Please also Do the independent study case-study questions on Canvas (under the week 6 modules)**
_The case-study questions Are part of the term assignment, so please don’t ignore them_

# GENERAL TIPS FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS

* Be succinct and to the point – *Do not* exceed the word limit
* Don’t simply make assertions – justify your claims with arguments based on research supported by references
* Use the links and resources provided for reference, but do your own research as well
* Use the textbook and lecture slides to learn & understand the unit content and apply the concepts in your answers
* Brainstorm ideas as a group and divide the work fairly and evenly
* Save your responses to the term assignment questions in your group’s shared working area
* Explicitly state any assumptions that you make (doesn’t count towards word count).
