# AGENDA
1. Icebreaker
2. Discussion questions
3. Term assignment questions


# Icebreaker
What is one quality you would like to see in a fellow team member?

# Discussion Questions
_PARTICIPATION MARKS IN YOUR TERM ASSIGNMENT WILL BE BASED ON YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE DISCUSSION, SO PLEASE CONTRIBUTE MEANINGFULLY._

Consider the VR headset start-up scenario from last week.
Assume that you have hired a few engineers and an engineer manager to develop this product.
1. Discuss whether the new manager should be experienced in managing innovation. Give reasons for or against it.

# Term Assignment Questions
WEEK 4 ACTIVITY – BLOCKCHAIN START-UP - Innovation

As a newly formed start-up, your organisation needs good innovation processes to succeed. Your new employees are technically competent but somewhat inexperienced with talking to customers, and
some have concerns about the future of your start-up.

You manage to convince your engineers and engineering managers to talk to a group of customers, and work begins on new features. However, there is disagreement on how to make decisions and if they need to continue to engage with customers.


## QUESTION (FOR BOTH 9789 & 9784)
Identify the problem or problems in the scenario on the previous slide and explain the approach that you will take to address the issue.
  1. Describe the problem(s), using the knowledge and techniques you've acquired from the unit and your own research in less than 100 words.
  2. Explain in less than 300 words how you will help your team engage with customers and settle on a way to work as a team. State which artefacts, processes, or other governance mechanisms you would use and why to
ensure the team remains focused on customer value alignment.

*Note:* These questions don’t have a single right or wrong answer, so focus on supporting arguments and explicitly state your assumptions (assumptions are excluded from the word count).


# GENERAL TIPS FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS

* Be succinct and to the point – *Do not* exceed the word limit
* Don’t simply make assertions – justify your claims with arguments based on research supported by references
* Use the links and resources provided for reference, but do your own research as well
* Use the textbook and lecture slides to learn & understand the unit content and apply the concepts in your answers
* Brainstorm ideas as a group and divide the work fairly and evenly
* Save your responses to the term assignment questions in your group’s shared working area
* Explicitly state any assumptions that you make (doesn’t count towards word count)
