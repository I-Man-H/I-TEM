# Discussion Questions

Some of the most innovative and engaging products in the market today were created through cultures that embraced contemporary ways of thinking and abandoned traditional mindsets.

After watching the video:

1. How do you feel about the content?
2. What do you think about the content?
3. What is the key takeaway for you professionally?

# Term Assignment

_Week 10 Activity - Blockchain Start-Up_

## SCENARIO – UCCHAIN Managing non-technical elements

* At UCChain, you have had some incredible success with developing and selling your products. The workshop you ran with the Venture Capitalists and senior/long-standing staff was successful.
* Because of your successes, you have increased your staff numbers, and as such, you have had to deal with the impacts and complexity of this.
* One of the issues you feel you are having is that teams are not achieving their full potential and do not have a chance to learn or be innovative.

## QUESTION – Learning (FOR BOTH 9789 & 9784)

In 450 words explain the approaches, tools or techniques you could use across UCChain to:
1. help teams be more like teams and less like groups of individuals.
2. increase learning within teams
3. capture the practices that work and communicate them to allow teams to consider adopting them.

**_Hint:_** There are lots of different directions you could take this question
* we want to see your thinking and use of the material we have shared with you.
* If you wish to declare some assumptions, these are outside of the word count.


## SCENARIO – UCCHAIN Managing non-technical elements

* Your attempts to motivate staff have been successful.
* This has led to a flurry of new innovative ideas being shared.
* Out of these ideas, one team have pitched a new product to you and you think it will be a great addition to the suite of products you already have.
* After building a prototype and testing with the market you decide its worth further investment.

## QUESTION - Communication (FOR 9784 only)

1. Based on the information in the previous slide, choose a stakeholder tool/s to capture and categorise the stakeholders that will be impacted by the new product.
2. In 300 words, based on your use of the tool, explain how you will engage with these stakeholders and the approach you will take.

**_Hint:_** There are stakeholder tools (e.g. matrix, blast radius) in the lecture material.
Feel free to make any relevant assumptions (these are not counted in your word count).

# GENERAL TIPS FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS

* Be succinct and to the point – *Do not* exceed the word limit
* Don’t simply make assertions – justify your claims with arguments based on research supported by references
* Use the links and resources provided for reference, but do your own research as well
* Use the textbook and lecture slides to learn & understand the unit content and apply the concepts in your answers
* Brainstorm ideas as a group and divide the work fairly and evenly
* Save your responses to the term assignment questions in your group’s shared working area
* Explicitly state any assumptions that you make (doesn’t count towards word count).
