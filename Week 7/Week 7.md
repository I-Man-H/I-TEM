2. How might someone use knowledge of their own strengths as a leader to adapt to different situations and contexts?

# Term Assignment
WEEK 7 ACTIVITY – BLOCKCHAIN START-UP

* At UCChain, you’ve accepted an investment proposal from a Venture Capital firm.
* This secures your future and enables you to hire and grow with confidence and firm commitments.
* However, it adds complexity. You have new and enthusiastic shareholders to manage, and nervous employees who are worried you will lose your unique organisational culture.
* You decide to lead a workshop with your new stakeholders and long-standing staff members.

## QUESTION (FOR BOTH 9789 & 9784) –Leadership

Outline an approach to the workshop that will both
  * create common ground, and
  * establish a shared vision

Specify what frameworks and tools you will use and what leadership challenges you will face. (300 words or less).

**_Hint:_** Feel free to make any relevant assumptions (these are not counted in your word count) and refer to your strategic plan.

# GENERAL TIPS FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS

* Be succinct and to the point – *Do not* exceed the word limit
* Don’t simply make assertions – justify your claims with arguments based on research supported by references
* Use the links and resources provided for reference, but do your own research as well
* Use the textbook and lecture slides to learn & understand the unit content and apply the concepts in your answers
* Brainstorm ideas as a group and divide the work fairly and evenly
* Save your responses to the term assignment questions in your group’s shared working area
* Explicitly state any assumptions that you make (doesn’t count towards word count)
