# DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
_PARTICIPATION MARKS IN YOUR TERM ASSIGNMENT WILL BE BASED ON YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE DISCUSSION, SO PLEASE CONTRIBUTE MEANINGFULLY._

In this week's lecture we did a deep dive into Scrum.

Thinking back, or looking at the slides, let's discuss the implications of using the Scrum framework to deliver software:
  1. What are some of the advantages or disadvantages of using Scrum?
  2. What are some techniques or methods you might employ if you were a developer working in a scrum team?


# TERM ASSIGNMENT

1. Assume that after thorough market-research and studying the Australian national blockchain roadmap, you have decided to form a new tech start-up called UCChain that specialises in
developing blockchain-based services for the automotive industry.
2. You can make assumptions about the exact types of services you’re offering.
3. Here are some articles on how blockchain can be used in the automotive industry:

# SCENARIO – UCCHAIN ORGANISING

* At UCChain, your technical lead has suggested that the team adopt Scrum to develop and deliver your product.
* You have been doing most of the customer research and conversations. There is a suggestion that you would therefore be best placed to be the Product Owner.


## QUESTION (FOR BOTH 9789 & 9784) – Scrum

1. Based on the information provided in the previous slide, explain why you believe Scrum would be an appropriate framework for this product team (200 words or less).
2. Explain what your role as the product owner would involve (200 words or less).

_HINT:_ Feel free to make any relevant assumptions (these are not counted in your word count) and refer to your strategic plan.


# SCENARIO – UCCHAIN FINANCIAL CONTROL

As a Product Owner at UCChain, you have autonomy to make decisions about the product being built by the Scrum team.

## QUESTIONS (For 9784 only) – Product Owner

As the Product Owner, you have noticed that the Technical Lead has rearranged some of the Product Backlog items. This occurred after they were arranged
in customer value and priority order during a discussion with the team.
  *  In 300 words explain why this might be an issue and how you might address it.

# GENERAL TIPS FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS

* Be succinct and to the point – *Do not* exceed the word limit
* Don’t simply make assertions – justify your claims with arguments based on research supported by references
* Use the links and resources provided for reference, but do your own research as well
* Use the textbook and lecture slides to learn & understand the unit content and apply the concepts in your answers
* Brainstorm ideas as a group and divide the work fairly and evenly
* Save your responses to the term assignment questions in your group’s shared working area
* Explicitly state any assumptions that you make (doesn’t count towards word count)
