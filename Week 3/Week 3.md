# DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

***PARTICIPATION MARKS IN YOUR TERM ASSIGNMENT WILL BE BASED ON YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE DISCUSSION, SO PLEASE CONTRIBUTE MEANINGFULLY.***

## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1. Assume that you’re in the early stages of the VR headset start-up, when you just have a general idea about what product you want to develop.
  * Why is planning important? What are the different factors you’d consider while planning & why?
  * What are some risks involved with VR technology that you need to be mindful of when making decisions?
2. Assume that you’ve grown into a medium-sized organisation and have been selling VR headsets for a few years. You need to make an important decision about whether or not to sign an expensive exclusivity deal with a reputable game studio for their upcoming game.
  * What might you consider before making this decision?

# SCENARIO – UCCHAIN DECISION MAKING

A large European manufacturer has approached UCChain to assist them in utilising blockchain technology. They have invited you to submit a plan for one of 3 development options:
  a) a new server OS that can process blockchain transactions faster (A1)
  b) a new API to integrate existing services with self-driving cars (A2)
  c) a new hashing algorithm that improves the security of the blockchain (A3)

Your Engineering manager has provided the following estimates of the costs to develop each option and the expected revenue from two success scenarios.
