# WEEK 3 - METHODS FOR T&E INNOVATION

# AGENDA

* Discussion questions
* Term assignment questions

# DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

***PARTICIPATION MARKS IN YOUR TERM ASSIGNMENT WILL BE BASED ON YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE DISCUSSION, SO PLEASE CONTRIBUTE MEANINGFULLY.***

## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1. Assume that you’re in the early stages of the VR headset start-up, when you just have a general idea about what product you want to develop.
  * Why is planning important? What are the different factors you’d consider while planning & why?
  * What are some risks involved with VR technology that you need to be mindful of when making decisions?
2. Assume that you’ve grown into a medium-sized organisation and have been selling VR headsets for a few years. You need to make an important decision about whether or not to sign an expensive exclusivity deal with a reputable game studio for their upcoming game.
  * What might you consider before making this decision?
 
# TERM ASSIGNMENT
WEEK 3 ACTIVITY – BLOCKCHAIN START- UP STRATEGIC PLANNING, FORECASTING & DECISION MAKING

## SCENARIO – UCCHAIN BACKGROUND

1. Assume that after thorough market research and studying the Australian national blockchain roadmap, you have decided to form a new tech start-up called _UCChain_ that specialises in developing blockchain-based services for the automotive industry.
2. You can make assumptions about the exact types of services you’re offering.
3. Here are some articles on how blockchain can be used in the automotive industry:

# QUESTION (FOR BOTH 9789 & 9784) – STRATEGIC PLAN    

1. Develop a strategic plan for your organisation by defining the following
  * A clear, concise Mission Statement (The Why)
  * At least One Objective to help you achieve your Mission (The What)
  * At least Two Strategies per objective (The How)
  * At least two tactics for each strategy (The Details)

***Note:*** Use _SMART_ principles – specific, measurable, achievable, realistic & timely


# SCENARIO – UCCHAIN DECISION MAKING

A large European manufacturer has approached UCChain to assist them in utilising blockchain technology. They have invited you to submit a plan for one of 3 development options:
  a) a new server OS that can process blockchain transactions faster (A1)
  b) a new API to integrate existing services with self-driving cars (A2)
  c) a new hashing algorithm that improves the security of the blockchain (A3)

Your Engineering manager has provided the following estimates of the costs to develop each option and the expected revenue from two success scenarios.


|  **OPTION** | **COST TO DEVELOP SOLUTION** | **MODERATE SUCCESS** |  **GREAT SUCCESS** |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| a | -60,000 | 250,000 | 350,000 |
| b | -400,000 | 300,000 | 930,000 |
| c | -25,000 | 125,000 | 275,000 |

# QUESTIONS (FOR BOTH 9789 & 9784) – DECISION MAKING

1. Using the information from the Engineering Manager on the previous page, which development option (a,b, or c) will you move forward with and why?
2. Using the option you selected above, use a Wardley Mapping approach or a high-level project plan (overview, timeline and major deliverables) for completing the work. Complete either of these options on one (1) page.
3. In less than 300 words, describe your considerations and assumptions, and whether you are optimising for time, cost, or quality, and why.

# QUESTION (FOR 9784 ONLY) – FORECASTING

Read the following technology and answer the following questions.

1. In less than 200 words, predict some existing technologies that may be substituted by blockchain in the future
2. In less than 350 words, describe how you envision a digital world that has been transformed by blockchain would look like.


# GENERAL TIPS FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS

* Be succinct and to the point – *Do not* exceed the word limit
* Don’t simply make assertions – justify your claims with arguments based on research supported by references
* Use the links and resources provided for reference, but do your own research as well
* Use the textbook and lecture slides to learn & understand the unit content and apply the concepts in your answers
* Brainstorm ideas as a group and divide the work fairly and evenly
* Save your responses to the term assignment questions in your group’s shared working area
* Explicitly state any assumptions that you make (doesn’t count towards word count)
