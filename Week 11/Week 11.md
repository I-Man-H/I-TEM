# Agenda
1. Discussion Questions
2. Term Assignment Questions

# Discussion Questions
_PARTICIPATION MARKS IN YOUR TERM ASSIGNMENT WILL BE BASED ON YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE DISCUSSION, SO PLEASE CONTRIBUTE MEANINGFULLY._

Your VR Headset start-up has grown a lot. It now has a sizeable division of programmers, testers, and user experience designers. You are the Director of Engineering.

At the next management meeting, the teams are asking for policy guidance on using AI in the code generation and testing of product development.
  * What considerations would you have for this conversation?
  * From a business perspective, what would you care about when deciding on an AI policy?
  * What are some of the ethical, legal and regulatory considerations for the use of AI for code generation?


# Term Assignment

_Week 11 Activity - Ethics_

## SCENARIO – UCSmartHealth: Trial of Wearable Blood Sampler

UCChain has partnered with and is providing a blockchain solution to UCSmartHealth. Remember UCSmartHealth?

UCSmartHealth has done great with Paco's renewed leadership after a challenging start. Paco's team has developed their first prototype, and the prototype is (almost) ready for trials.

The prototype (codename: “There Are Knots”) has a new nano-technology capability that - if the wearer provides permission - can take a blood sample from the wearer’s wrist, process it
in situ, and commit the results to the wearer’s wallet in the blockchain service that holds the data.

Paco is very proud of his team’s work on integrating this nano-technology into a wearable device and its connection to UCChain.


## SCENARIO - Preparation for Trial 

The Executive will meet the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) this week to get final approval for the trial. They have asked Paco for a diagrammatic plan for the wearable trial that identifies key ethical issues, legal responsibilities and regulatory issues.

There is only a short window to discuss the trial, so the TGA must have a single one-page document to take away.

## QUESTION – Ethics, Legal Responsibilities, and Regulatory Issues (FOR BOTH 9789 & 9784)

Paco has provided you with a Sun Ray diagram as a template for you to run your group workshop identifying the ethical, legal and regulatory challenges for running the There are Knots trial outlined in the previous slide. Arrange findings on the diagram:
1. Arrange findings on the template
2. Arrange mitigations to the findings on the template

**_Hint_**: ensure they connect and make sense.

➡️ Sun Ray Template can be accessed [Here](https://uclearn.canberra.edu.au/courses/15489/files/4661546?module_item_id=1173177)

## SCENARIO – Root Cause Analysis

As outlined, the trial is expected to run for 3 months with 400 users of the device that can remotely take blood samples and process them in situ. The CEO is concerned about the risks.

## QUESTION – Dilemma (9784 only)

The Chief Risk Officer has concerns that a hacker could damage UCSmartHealth’s reputation by compromising and controlling the wearable devices and inflicting harm on the users.
You decide to conduct a pre-mortem in your team assuming that the worst-case scenario outlined by the CRO has happened.

  * On one page, provide a fishbone diagram that outlines one or more root cause/s of the scenario above.

**_Hint:_** Ishakawa can help. Use your imagination about the things that could go wrong.

# GENERAL TIPS FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS

* Be succinct and to the point – *Do not* exceed the word limit
* Don’t simply make assertions – justify your claims with arguments based on research supported by references
* Use the links and resources provided for reference, but do your own research as well
* Use the textbook and lecture slides to learn & understand the unit content and apply the concepts in your answers
* Brainstorm ideas as a group and divide the work fairly and evenly
* Save your responses to the term assignment questions in your group’s shared working area
* Explicitly state any assumptions that you make (doesn’t count towards word count).
